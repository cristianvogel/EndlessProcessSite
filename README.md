# Endless Process
## Reimagining the music label website for 2023
_WIP_

These days, a music label is more like a brand than a product manufacturer.

I believe a label site needs to use all the latest technologies, to bring that brand to life.

_ESPECIALLY_ sound and music.  For example, I implemented a realtime granular scrub instead of your regular boring old progress bar. Try it, it sounds great thanks to Elementary running the audio processing. Another example of *sound-first* design thinking. Notice how the AI speech is *post-processed* in realtime to give it more mojo, as well as sidechaining the music, pirate radio style. This is what I am showcasing here. When you are label, your brand is expressed in the  *sonics* not only the visual design. 

Why should labels need to rely on third-party audio embeds, or be constrained to the old-school definitions of what an online music experience should feel like.

At Endless Process, the modern feeling impacts straight away. Because it bypasses the conventional technologies, like HTML5 players or embedded streaming audio from third-parties, we get the possibilities to do something else. 

The plan for Endless Process, is ambitious, and involves a seamless integration of realtime audio releases alongside recorded masters. 

Modern Music culture still talks deeply about expression. Let's make that possible for everyone to explore, in this golden age of  activism through creation.
